    <div class="poem">
    <h3>There's A Certain Slant of Light, by Emily Dickinson</h3>

      <p>There's a certain Slant of light,
      <br>Winter Afternoons —
      <br>That oppresses, like the Heft
      <br>Of Cathedral Tunes –</p>

      <p>Heavenly Hurt, it gives us –
      <br>We can find no scar,
      <br>But internal difference –
      <br>Where the Meanings, are –</p>

      <p>None may teach it – Any –
      <br>'Tis the seal Despair –
      <br>An imperial affliction
      <br>Sent us of the Air –</p>

      <p>When it comes, the Landscape listens –
      <br>Shadows – hold their breath –
      <br>When it goes, 'tis like the Distance
      <br>On the look of Death –</p>

    <h3>Traveler, your footprints, by Antonio Machado</h3>

      <p>Traveler, your footprints
      <br>are the only road, nothing else.
      <br>Traveler, there is no road;
      <br>you make your own path as you walk.
      <br>As you walk, you make your own road,
      <br>and when you look back
      <br>you see the path
      <br>you will never travel again.
      <br>Traveler, there is no road;
      <br>only a ship's wake on the sea.</p>

    <h3>The Soldier, by Rupert Brooke</h3>

    <p>
    <pre>
  If I should die, think only this of me:
     That there's some corner of a foreign field
  That is for ever England. There shall be
     In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
  A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
     Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam;
  A body of England's, breathing English air,
     Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

  And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
     A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
        Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
  Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
     And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
        In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.
    </pre>

    <h3>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night, by Dylan Thomas</h3>

      <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,
      <br>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
      <br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

      <p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
      <br>Because their words had forked no lightning they
      <br>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

      <p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
      <br>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
      <br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

      <p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
      <br>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
      <br>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

      <p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
      <br>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
      <br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

      <p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,
      <br>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
      <br>Do not go gentle into that good night.
      <br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

    <h3>Galaxy, by Issa</h3>

      <p>A lovely thing to see:
      <br>through the paper
      <br>window's hole,
      <br>the Galaxy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
    <h3>Arcturus In Autumn, by Sara Teasdale</h3>

      <p>When, in the gold October dusk, I saw you near to setting,
      <br>Arcturus, bringer of spring,
      <br>Lord of the summer nights, leaving us now in autumn,
      <br>Having no pity on our withering;</p>

      <p>Oh, then I knew at last that my own autumn was upon me,
      <br>I felt it in my blood,
      <br>Restless as dwindling streams that still remember
      <br>The music of their flood. There in the thickening dark a wind-bent tree above me
      <br>Loosed its last leaves in flight--
      <br>I saw you sink and vanish, pitiless Arcturus,
      <br>You will not stay to share our lengthening night.</p>

    <h3>Apollo 11, by a. davida jane</h3>

      <p>A rocket fired and a
      <br>breath taken, in unison.
      <br>Two pointed gazes tilted
      <br>up towards the night.</p>

      <p>The stickiness of the
      <br>atmosphere traps in
      <br>all the words I never
      <br>wrote down, and the poet
      <br>in me flinches as I soar
      <br>into outer space.</p>

      <p>Above, the moon watches with
      <br>a calm serentity the oceans
      <br>would deny and the stars
      <br>scatter out of the ship's way,
      <br>eager to avoid a collision.</p>

      <p>The poet starts counting
      <br>her breaths with her heartbeats
      <br>one timer in each hand as she
      <br>writes with the ink
      <br>on her tongue across the
      <br>surface of the rock</p>

      <p>With no gravity to weigh
      <br>them down her words float
      <br>into the sky, splaying across
      <br>the black like constellations
      <br>and interfering with the
      <br>satellites, till they transmit
      <br>only poetry.</p>
